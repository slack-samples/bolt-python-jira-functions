# Bolt for Python Automation Template App

This is a generic Bolt for Python template app used to build out Slack automations.

Before getting started, make sure you have a development workspace where you have permissions to install apps. If you donâ€™t have one setup, go ahead and [create one](https://slack.com/create).

## Installation

#### Create a Slack App

1. Open [https://api.slack.com/apps/new](https://api.slack.com/apps/new) and choose "From an app manifest"
2. Choose the workspace you want to install the application to
3. Copy the contents of [manifest.json](./manifest.json) into the text box that says `*Paste your manifest code here*` (within the JSON tab) and click *Next*
4. Review the configuration and click *Create*
5. Click *Install to Workspace* and *Allow* on the screen that follows. You'll then be redirected to the App Configuration dashboard.

#### Environment Variables

Before you can run the app, you'll need to store some environment variables.

1. Rename `.env.sample` to `.env`
2. Open your apps configuration page from [this list](https://api.slack.com/apps), click *OAuth & Permissions* in the left hand menu, then copy the *Bot User OAuth Token* into your `.env` file under `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
3. Click *Basic Information* from the left hand menu and follow the steps in the *App-Level Tokens* section to create an app-level token with the `connections:write` scope. Copy that token into your `.env` as `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`.

### Setup Your Local Project

```zsh
# Clone this project onto your machine
git clone https://github.com/slack-samples/bolt-python-automation-template.git

# Change into this project directory
cd bolt-python-automation-template

# Set up virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Bolt server
slack run
```

#### Linting

```zsh
# Run flake8 from root directory for linting
flake8 *.py

# Run black from root directory for code formatting
black .
```

## Project Structure

### `manifest.json`

`manifest.json` is a configuration for Slack apps. With a manifest, you can create an app with a pre-defined configuration, or adjust the configuration of an existing app.

### `app.py`

`app.py` is the entry point for the application and is the file you'll run to start the server. This project aims to keep this file as thin as possible, primarily using it as a way to route inbound requests.
